## Business Description

The internet is a place where you are able to search for anything. When it comes to news media, one problem that occurs is that you are unable to get a variety of news articles from different sources that focus on a certain location that may be of interest to you. Most news articles and their sources are often localized based on your location. However, when breaking news occurs on the other side of the world, many local news sources fail to cover these stories.  Even if you turn your location off, the news articles present are often from major news sources that do not represent how news sources from other countries perceive an issue. There is no effective means of retreiving news information worldwide.  

Our solution is simple. Our application allows the person to select a country using the **Google Maps Javascript API** and retrieve news information **from the specific country** using **newsapi.org**. The person can specify filters on the news search to narrow down the information relevant to them. One filter that will be used in the application is the ability for the person to search the keywords of an article such as "Football". Another way the person can filter their search is by specifying the category of their search through a dropdown menu, choosing a result such as "Sports". Additional filters may be added in the future.
