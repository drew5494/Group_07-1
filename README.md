## Project Description

This project will retrieve news information targeted to a specific location in the world. The user will be able to select the location on a world map present in the website and have the site display relevant news articles based on the location selected. Some additional functionality might include:

- Displaying real-time articles directly on the map.
- Adding a search functionality/additional filters that narrows down the content of the articles.
- Adjusting the size of an indicator (e.g. red dot) based on the amount of news articles about a specific location.
