## System Description

Our solution is simple. We will use an API to retrieve that information. An API is an Application Programming Interface. It is used for retrieving data or tools that are located on another website. For example, we will use the **Google Maps Javascript API** which lets you add a customizable map to display on web pages and mobile devices. Our website will retrieve news information **from a specific country** using **newsapi.org**, which provides live news updates. The user can also apply specific filters such as sports, technology, business, and more on the news search to narrow down the information they are interested in. Additional filters may be added in the future. News articles, by default, will be sorted by newest first. The user has the option to sort by popularity or by oldest first.

## Description of Prototype to be delivered in BTS530

Our prototype will include:

- Connection to both the **Google Maps Javascript API** and the **newsapi.org**
- Filtering options
- Easy to navigate interface
